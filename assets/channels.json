This caused his humanity to go wild, leading to the creation of the Abyss. Manus went mad, eternally seeking his precious Broken Pendant.As the Abyss threatened to swallow the entirety of Oolacile, Knight Artorias, one of the Four Knights of Gwyn, travelled to Oolacile to face Manus. Artorias, a hero with nary a murmur of dark, was no match for the Father of the Abyss, and found himself corrupted by Manus' darkness.",

But when the gods found the Flame, Gwyn led his lords in a hunt that drove dragons to near-extinction. Many fought back, but some betrayed their kind. Midir's story is different.",

He is encountered inside the Erdtree in Leyndell, Ashen Capital, and is the first half of the final boss fight, with Elden Beast as the second half.Radagon first rose to prominence during the Liurnian Wars, when he joined the heroes' ranks. A great champion with flowing red locks, he arrived in Liurnia at the head of a golden host, where he met Queen Rennala in battle. Although two wars would be fought between them, the First Liurnian War, and the Second, no victor would emerge from either. Radagon eventually repented his territorial aggressions by cleansing himself with Celestial Dew, and swore his love to Rennala. Long ago, the Greater Will sent a golden star bearing a beast into the Lands Between, which would later became the Elden Ring. It was the vassal beast of the Greater Will and the living incarnation of the concept of Order. Marika, a Numen Empyrean, would became a goddess and the vessel of the Elden Ring and would establish the Golden Order and rule over the Lands Between as the one true god. However, Marika would eventually shatter the Elden Ring, leading to her imprisonment inside the Erdtree. After untold hardships, the Tarnished fights their way inside the Erdtree where they find the shackled Marika, and face Radagon, Marika's male other self and the reigning Elden Lord, the two of them sharing the same body. After his defeat, the Elden Beast emerges from Radagon, transforming Radagon's defeated body into a large sword, and faces the Tarnished.",

The unnamed shinobi that would become the Demon of Hatred was once a powerful shinobi known for training amongst the monkeys of Sunken Valley, giving him the nickname Orangutan. He rescued Emma as a child after she nearly starved on a battlefield and sent her to be raised by Dogen to become a doctor. Becoming enraptured by murder and bloodlust in his line of work, the Orangutan was infected by Shura, a twist in personality that turns one into a beast, only able to kill for the joy it brings. To save him from being consumed by Shura, Lord Isshin of the Ashina clan sliced off his left arm, losing the axe he used to fight with as well.",
