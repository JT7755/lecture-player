        "description": "Manus was a primordial human. The people of Oolacile were fooled by a serpent — presumably Kaathe — to excavate Manus's grave, which incited his wrath. This caused his humanity to go wild, leading to the creation of the Abyss. Manus went mad, eternally seeking his precious Broken Pendant.As the Abyss threatened to swallow the entirety of Oolacile, Knight Artorias, one of the Four Knights of Gwyn, travelled to Oolacile to face Manus. Artorias, a hero with nary a murmur of dark, was no match for the Father of the Abyss, and found himself corrupted by Manus' darkness.",
